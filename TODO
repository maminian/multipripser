! Shuffle the sequence of points in single_sequence_scaling
so that memory is distributed better throughout the
running (large and small problems get mixed in to the same
worker in the Pool)

! Another pass through all the scripts;
listing Purpose/Inputs/Outputs/Optional Inputs;
removing unnecessary baggage

! Cleaning up the entire interface; functions are 
spread over many files and ripser_interface 
is just a mess of importing all of them.

! Examining the ripser pypi package; how much of 
what we're doing here is now redundant/inefficient?
It's probably okay if we only provide some visualization tools.
This interface is pretty janky, after all.
